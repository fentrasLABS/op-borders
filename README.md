# Borders
Plugin for OpenPlanet that creates virtual borders around the screen.
Helpful for imitating arbitrary resolutions like 4:3 without stretching your resolution!

## Features
* Colors (opacity included)
* Size (adjusts to widescreen automatically)
* Order (overlay under the in-game UI)

## Limitations
* Borders disappear when the UI is hidden
    * Workaround will be added in the next version

## Download
* [OpenPlanet](https://openplanet.nl/files/118)
* [Releases](https://gitlab.com/DergnNamedSkye/op-borders/-/releases)
